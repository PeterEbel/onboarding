    "This document is intended to serve as a first introduction to programming Apache Spark using the Python framework PySpark. Basic knowledge of the Python programming language is required. The most important concepts and data structures of Spark, in particular Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) and DataFrames, are presented using short example programs. Jupyter Notebook and Microsoft Visual Code are used as development environments. Many of the examples are taken from the [official Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) and some have been slightly modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Apache Spark?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark™ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to create a development environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Install Docker**\n",
    "Install Docker following the instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download the jupyter/pyspark-notebook image\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed download the jupyter/pyspark-notebook image.\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker pull jupyter/pyspark-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a bash file\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a bash file (e.g. run.sh) with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "CONTAINER=$(docker run -d --rm --name my-pyspark -p 8888:8888 -v /home/peter/projects:/home/jovyan/work jupyter/pyspark-notebook)\n",

    "sleep 5\n",
    "docker exec $CONTAINER jupyter server list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows, create a corresponding Powershell file and adapt the syntax join above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second line creates a container (with the name \"my-pyspark\") from the downloaded image, maps the Juypter port 8888 so it becomes accessible outside the container under the same port number, and additionally maps the pre-configured home directory inside the container (/home/jovyan/work) to a folder in the file system of your operating system (here: /home/peter/projects). Any filed stored there will appear later inside the container as if it were local. The third and fourth line show how to copy libraries like database drivers into Sparks library folder inside the container (e.g. to read from a Postgres database within your Spark program).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser \n",
    "\n",
    "Open your preferred browser and enter the following as URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "localhost:8888/tree?token=0f9541f307a73fcd220474bfd24d2476ea145d58d165ad1b\n",
    "```\n",
    "The token (here: 0f9541f307a73fcd220474bfd24d2476ea145d58d165ad1b) will be different each time you start Jupyter Notebook. The token you need for the current Juypter session is shown on the screen when the run script terminates. Look for \"token=\".\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are RDDs?\n",
    "A __RDD__, or Resilient Distributed Dataset, is a fundamental data structure in Apache Spark. RDDs are designed to provide an efficient and fault-tolerant way to distribute and process data across a cluster of computers. They have several key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Resilient:__ RDDs are \"resilient\" because they can recover from node failures. If a node in the cluster fails, the data and the operations applied to it can be reconstructed on another node, ensuring fault tolerance.\n",
    "* __Distributed:__ RDDs are distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing of data. This distribution is a fundamental feature of Spark, making it suitable for handling large datasets.\n",
    "* __Immutable:__ Once created, RDDs are immutable, meaning their data cannot be changed. Instead, transformations applied to an RDD result in the creation of new RDDs, which helps maintain data consistency and enables lineage information for fault recovery.\n",
    "* __In-Memory:__ RDDs are typically stored in memory, which makes them faster to access and process compared to reading and writing to disk. This in-memory storage is one of the key performance benefits of Spark.\n",
    "* __Lazy execution:__ When Spark transforms data, it does not immediately compute the transformation but plans how to compute later. When actions such as collect() are explicitly called, the computation starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common operations on RDDs include mapping, filtering, reducing, and joining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While RDDs were the primary data abstraction in earlier versions of Spark, more recent versions introduced __DataFrames__ and Datasets, which provide higher-level abstractions and optimizations for structured data processing. Nevertheless, RDDs still play a crucial role in Spark, particularly when you need fine-grained control over data and operations or when working with unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are DataFrames?\n",
    "Spark __DataFrames__ are a distributed collection of data organized into named columns, much like a table in a relational database or a data frame in R or Python. They are a higher-level abstraction built on top of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in Apache Spark, designed to provide a more structured and optimized way to work with data. DataFrames were introduced in Spark 2.0 to address the limitations of RDDs, particularly when dealing with structured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features and characteristics of Spark DataFrames include:\n",
    "* __Schema:__ DataFrames have a well-defined schema that describes the structure of the data, including column names and data types. This schema information helps Spark optimize query execution and provides type safety.\n",
    "* __Performance:__ DataFrames are designed for optimized performance. Spark can leverage the schema information to perform predicate pushdown, column pruning, and other query optimizations to speed up data processing.\n",
    "* __Language support:__ DataFrames are available in multiple programming languages, including Scala, Java, Python, and R. This means you can work with DataFrames in a language you're comfortable with.\n",
    "* __Interoperability:__ DataFrames can seamlessly interoperate with RDDs, allowing you to use the right data abstraction for your specific use case.\n",
    "* __Catalyst query optimizer:__ Spark DataFrames use the Catalyst query optimizer, which is a powerful tool for optimizing query plans. Catalyst can apply a wide range of optimizations, making queries more efficient.\n",
    "* __Tungsten execution engine:__ DataFrames also use the Tungsten execution engine, which is designed for code generation and in-memory processing. This engine further enhances performance.\n",
    "* __Data sources:__ DataFrames can read and write data from various sources, including Parquet, Avro, ORC, JSON, CSV, and more, making it easy to work with a variety of data formats.\n",
    "* __SQL support:__ Spark DataFrames support SQL queries, enabling you to write SQL-like statements for data manipulation and analysis."
